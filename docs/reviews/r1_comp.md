## Stakeholders, Advocates, and Target
### Potential Stakeholders

DBO is collecting, processing, and refining non-traditional data associated with NFL players, coaches, teams, and owners. Moreover it's working to generate a model (understanding) of how these indicators may or may not impact traditional performance statistics. Since this is well-structured data, with understand, major stakeholders could be existing sports traditional data API providers, fantasy platforms, betting companies, or media outlets.

- Sports Data Providers - Could integrate this feed into existing platform and offerings
	- e.g., Sportsdata.io, Opta, etc.
- Fantasy Platforms - Data feed to enrich to provide unique insights and news
	- Sleeper, Yahoo Fantasy, ESPN Fantasy, etc.
- Betting Companies - Data feed that could be marketed as an additional edge
	- DraftKings, FanDuel, etc.
- Media Outlets - Help generate unique commentary insights
	- NFL Network, Bleacher, etc

Most likely stakeholder is Sports Data Providers.

### Potential Advocates

Content creators, influences, and sports communities want to find unique data do that can create and publish information to attract users. DBO is a unique-spin for this on non-traditional data.

- Fantasy Sports Influencers
- Sports Content Creators
- Fantasy Sports Communities

### Target Audience

- Casual Fantasy Players
- Casual Sports Bettors
- NFL Fans
- Content Creators/Steamers

## Total Addressable Market

Cross-analysis of the target audience (not double counting) comes to about 70M people in the U.S. 

Most fantasy players or bettors are men (81%) between 18 and 49.  If we can penetrate 10% of that market, that's roughly 1.8M users.

What's interesting to think about, is that non of the above companies target women specifically at all! According to FSGA, 19% of fantasy players are women or about 11M.  This is an underserved market. How could DBO be tailored to capture this market?

### Further Research

According to HBR, User-centric design for Women or WCD puts heavy emphasis on contextual explanations, personalization, and emotional appeal.
