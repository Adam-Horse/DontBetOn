# Stakeholders, Advocates, and Target

## Potential Stakeholders

Moreover it's working to generate a model (understanding) of how these indicators may or may not impact traditional performance statistics. Since this is well-structured data, with understand, major stakeholders could be existing sports traditional data API providers, fantasy platforms, betting companies, or media outlets.

- Sports Data Providers - Could integrate this feed into existing platform and offerings

## Target Audience

## Total Addressable Market

Cross-analysis of the target audience (not double counting) comes to about 70M people in the U.S. 

Most fantasy players or bettors are men (81%) between 18 and 49.  If we can penetrate 10% of that market, that's roughly 1.8M users.

What's interesting to think about, is that non of the above companies target women specifically at all! According to FSGA, 19% of fantasy players are women or about 11M.  This is an underserved market. How could DBO be tailored to capture this market?
