# Don't Bet On

**"Don't Bet On"** (DBO) helps users avoid selecting underperforming NFL players by combining traditional performance metrics with **non-traditional data**, such as late-night activities, social media engagement, dating, lifestyle impacts, and more. These provide unique contextual explanations of how off-field factors influence player performance.

DBO addresses gaps in fantasy sports and betting platforms by integrating **non-traditional data** and allowing users to contribute their own knowledge to enhance player performance insights. This holistic approach, considering human and emotional factors, is important for users seeking a broader view.

An analysis of 18 companies (including sports betting, fantasy platforms, data providers, and media) revealed that most rely on traditional data like statistics, injury reports, and betting odds. Only 3 companies leveraged non-traditional data, such as RFID and AI technologies used by Zebra Sports and NFL Next Gen Stats for real-time on-field player data, and Unabated, which provided insights into real-time betting activities. Most of these services focused on passive consumption (e.g., player rankings, news) rather than user engagement. Only Sleeper and Unabated fostered user participation.

DBO aims to address both of these gaps—non-traditional data integration and user engagement—on a smaller scale.
